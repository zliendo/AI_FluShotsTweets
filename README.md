# Identifying Tweets against the flu shot using deep learning models

**December 2017**

This repository contains the code U implemented for a project that needed to identify in real time tweets that were against the flu shot. The system used deep learning models, like CNN and LSTM with attention, using 
embeddings for natural language processing.   

The code was implemented on December 2017, during my graduate studies at the Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) 
program at UC Berkeley. The class was: W241 Experiments and Causal Inference
